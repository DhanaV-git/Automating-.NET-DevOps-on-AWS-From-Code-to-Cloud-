# 🚀 Automating .NET DevOps on AWS – From Code to Cloud! ☁️🐳
I just wrapped up an exciting end-to-end DevOps pipeline for a .NET application, leveraging some of the best cloud-native tools! 🌍✨

Here’s how I transformed source code into a production-ready deployment on AWS—fully automated! ⚡
🔥 Tech Stack in Action

🔹 GitHub – Source control & collaboration 🧑‍💻
🔹 Jenkins – CI/CD automation 🏗️
🔹 SonarQube – Code quality & security 🛡️
🔹 Docker – Containerization 🐳
🔹 AWS ECR – Storing container images 📦
🔹 Terraform – Infrastructure as Code ⚒️
🔹 AWS EKS – Kubernetes cluster deployment ☸️
🔹 FluxCD – GitOps-driven deployments 🔄
🔹 AWS ECS – Alternative container orchestration 🚢
🔹 API Gateway & Load Balancer – Traffic management 🌐
🔹 CloudWatch & Prometheus – Monitoring & logging 📊
🚀 Step-by-Step Execution: The DevOps Flow

🔹 📌 Step 1: Development & Version Control

    Code is pushed to GitHub following a GitFlow strategy.
    PRs undergo peer review & SonarQube analysis to maintain quality. ✅

🔹 🛠️ Step 2: Continuous Integration with Jenkins

    Jenkins Pipeline pulls the latest code.
    Runs unit tests 🧪 & SonarQube scans 🔍.
    Builds & packages the .NET app using dotnet publish.

🔹 🐳 Step 3: Containerization & Image Push

    Creates a Docker image 🏗️.
    Pushes to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) 📦.

🔹 🌍 Step 4: Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform

    Provisions an EKS Cluster ☸️.
    Deploys ECS Cluster for additional workloads.
    Sets up IAM Roles, Load Balancers, API Gateway.

🔹 ⚡ Step 5: Kubernetes Deployment with FluxCD

    FluxCD auto-syncs Kubernetes manifests from GitHub.
    App is deployed to AWS EKS, fully GitOps-driven 🔄.

🔹 🌐 Step 6: Traffic Routing & Scaling

    API requests flow through API Gateway 🚦.
    ALB routes traffic to microservices.
    Auto Scaling ensures high availability 🔄.

🔹 📊 Step 7: Monitoring & Observability

    Logs collected via CloudWatch 📈.
    Prometheus + Grafana for cluster health monitoring 💡.

🎯 The Impact?

✅ Zero manual deployments – Everything is automated!
✅ Faster releases – CI/CD ensures quick feedback loops.
✅ High availability – Auto-scaling & self-healing clusters.
✅ Infrastructure as Code (IaC) – No manual setup, just Terraform!
🎉 Final Thoughts & Next Steps

This was an amazing learning experience 💡! DevOps is all about speed, automation, and reliability—and this project delivered on all fronts. 🚀
