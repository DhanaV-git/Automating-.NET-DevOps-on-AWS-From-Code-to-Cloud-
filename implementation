1. Development Phase
GitHub - Source Code Management

    The development team writes the .NET application (ASP.NET Core or any .NET variant).
    The code is managed using GitHub in a repository.
    A branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow) is followed:
        Main Branch – Stable production-ready code.
        Develop Branch – Integrates new features before merging to the main branch.
        Feature Branches – Developers work on new features in separate branches.
    Developers push their code to GitHub and create Pull Requests (PRs) for peer review.

SonarQube - Code Quality & Security Scanning

    SonarQube is integrated with GitHub using webhooks.
    It runs automated code analysis upon pull requests and commits.
    Reports code smells, bugs, vulnerabilities, and security flaws.
    Developers fix the reported issues before merging.

2. Continuous Integration (CI) - Jenkins Pipeline
Jenkins - Automated Build & Testing

    Jenkins Setup:
        Installed on an EC2 instance or as a container.
        Uses GitHub Webhooks to trigger builds on new commits.
        Configured with a Jenkinsfile (Declarative or Scripted Pipeline).

    Pipeline Stages:
        Clone Repository:
            Pull the latest code from GitHub.
        Run Unit Tests:
            Executes .NET Core xUnit/NUnit/MSTest test cases.
        Static Code Analysis:
            SonarQube analysis is triggered.
        Build the Application:
            Runs .NET publish to create the application binaries.
        Create Docker Image:
            Builds a Docker container for the application.
        Push to Docker Hub or AWS ECR:
            Image is tagged with version (app:v1.0) and pushed.

3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) - Terraform
Terraform - AWS Infrastructure Provisioning

    Terraform is used to provision AWS resources, ensuring repeatability.

    The main infrastructure includes:
        EKS Cluster (Managed Kubernetes Service)
        ECS Cluster (For running additional containerized workloads)
        IAM Roles (Permissions for AWS services)
        VPC, Subnets, Security Groups (Networking)
        RDS/Database (If needed)
        API Gateway (Exposing endpoints)
        Elastic Load Balancer (ALB/NLB) (Traffic management)

    Terraform Execution:

    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply

4. Continuous Deployment (CD) - FluxCD
FluxCD - GitOps for Kubernetes

    FluxCD automates the deployment of the application to AWS EKS.
    Monitors GitHub repositories for changes in Kubernetes manifests stored in a deployments repo.
    Applies these manifests to the cluster automatically.

5. Deployment on AWS
Containerization

    Docker (Containerization):
        Application is containerized using a Dockerfile.
        Sample Dockerfile:

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0
COPY ./publish /app
WORKDIR /app
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MyApp.dll"]

Image is built and pushed:

        docker build -t myapp:v1 .
        docker tag myapp:v1 <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/myapp:v1
        docker push <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/myapp:v1

Kubernetes (AWS EKS)

    EKS Cluster Setup (via Terraform)
        Creates an Amazon EKS cluster with necessary node groups.

    Deploy Application to EKS
        Create a Kubernetes Deployment and Service YAML:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/myapp:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80

Apply the deployment:

        kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

AWS ECS Deployment (Alternative to EKS)

    Uses Fargate or EC2-backed ECS instances.
    Define a Task Definition and Service.

6. Networking & Security
IAM - Permissions Management

    Roles for:
        Jenkins (Access to ECR, EKS, ECS)
        EKS Worker Nodes (To pull images)
        ECS Task Role (For container execution)

Load Balancers & API Gateway

    Load Balancer (ALB/NLB)
        Routes traffic to EKS pods.
        ALB Ingress Controller for EKS.
    API Gateway
        Exposes microservices.
        Routes requests to either EKS/ECS containers.

7. Monitoring & Logging

    CloudWatch Logs: For ECS, EKS, and API Gateway logs.
    Prometheus + Grafana: Monitoring Kubernetes metrics.
    AWS X-Ray: Tracing API calls.

8. Scaling & Auto-recovery

    Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for EKS
    ECS Auto Scaling
    Load Balancer Target Groups distribute traffic.

End-to-End Flow Summary

    Developers push code → GitHub
    Jenkins triggers build → Runs tests & SonarQube analysis
    Docker image created → Pushed to AWS ECR
    Terraform provisions AWS infra (EKS, ECS, IAM, API Gateway, Load Balancers)
    FluxCD deploys app to EKS
    Application exposed via Load Balancer & API Gateway
    Monitoring via CloudWatch & Prometheus
    Auto-scaling & self-healing ensure uptime
